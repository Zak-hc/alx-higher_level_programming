Before the execution of line 2 (print("Love")), a total of 27 int objects have been created and are still in memory.

This can be explained by the small integer caching mechanism in CPython. In CPython, small integers in the range [-5, 256] are pre-allocated and shared, which means they are created once and reused throughout the program. This optimization helps to improve performance and reduce memory consumption.

Considering the code provided, the integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are created as small integer objects when executing line 1 (print("I")). Similarly, the integers -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, and 6 are created when executing line 3 (print("Python")). Since line 2 (print("Love")) does not involve the creation of any new integers, the total count remains at 27.
