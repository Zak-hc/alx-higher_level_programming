Before the execution of line 2 (print("Love")), no explicit integer objects have been created or used. The statements "I", "Love", and "Python" are string literals and do not involve the creation of integer objects.

The number of int objects created and still in memory at that point would be determined by the pre-allocated and cached small integer range, which depends on the specific implementation of CPython. Based on the default values (`NSMALLPOSINTS = 257` and `NSMALLNEGINTS = -5`), there would be a total of 263 small integer objects available for reuse in memory.
